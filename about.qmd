# Andrew Setiono, S. Psi, M. Si 

I am a recent graduate from the Research Master program at the Faculty of Behavioral and Social Sciences, [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/masters/behavioural-and-social-sciences-research/). 

Passionate about understanding and solving complex organizational phenomena, 
I specialize in advanced statistical methods with a focus on multilevel modeling. 

My research interests span topics such as hybrid work, workplace aging, and the influence of family-supportive leadership.
